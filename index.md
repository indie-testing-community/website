## Welcome to the Indie Testing Community

The Indie Testing Community’s purpose is to create a safe environment for anyone who wants to come together to learn and share knowledge. Our goal is to support each other while connecting. Our community is a safe space for people who work in software testing or related software quality fields, to chat, support each other, and to learn.

## Who can join?

Anyone

## How we behave

Be kind, be respectful, and look out for others.

Unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated in this community, at any time, for any reason. It is dedicated to providing a safe and harassment-free experience for everyone. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the community admins.

Members asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. If a member engages in harassing behaviour, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from Indie Testing Community.

For full details, take a look at our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/indie-testing-community/documents/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) (work in progress). By joining this Slack, you agree to abide by the CoC and to follow the directions of the moderation team.

## Getting to know the community

1. Please head to **#introductions** and introduce yourself, we’d love to know more about you!
2. Browse through the available channels and join any that interest you.
3. We encourage you to add a photo of yourself to your profile, but if you are uncomfortable doing so, feel free to add anything else you feel represents you!

## Suggestions or feedback
This is a new endeavour for a lot of us, and starting a whole new Slack community means that a bunch of the setup and functions that we benefitted from in the MoT Slack might not be implemented here. Please reach out in the **#admin** channel if you have any suggestions or ideas about things we can implement.
