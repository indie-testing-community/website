<p>The Indie Testing Community’s purpose is to create a safe environment for anyone who wants to come together to learn and share knowledge. Our goal is to support each other while connecting. Our community is a safe space for people who work in software testing or related software quality fields, to chat, support each other, and to learn.</p>

<h2 id="who-can-join">Who can join?</h2>

<p>Anyone</p>

<h2 id="how-we-behave">How we behave</h2>

<p>Be kind, be respectful, and look out for others.</p>

<p>Unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated in this community, at any time, for any reason. It is dedicated to providing a safe and harassment-free experience for everyone. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the community admins.</p>

<p>Members asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. If a member engages in harassing behaviour, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from Indie Testing Community.</p>

<p>For full details, take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/indie-testing-community/documents/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md">Code of Conduct</a> (work in progress). By joining this Slack, you agree to abide by the CoC and to follow the directions of the moderation team.</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-know-the-community">Getting to know the community</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Please head to <strong>#introductions</strong> and introduce yourself, we’d love to know more about you!</li>
  <li>Browse through the available channels and join any that interest you.</li>
  <li>We encourage you to add a photo of yourself to your profile, but if you are uncomfortable doing so, feel free to add anything else you feel represents you!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="suggestions-or-feedback">Suggestions or feedback</h2>
<p>This is a new endeavour for a lot of us, and starting a whole new Slack community means that a bunch of the setup and functions that we benefitted from in the MoT Slack might not be implemented here. Please reach out in the <strong>#admin</strong> channel if you have any suggestions or ideas about things we can implement.</p>
